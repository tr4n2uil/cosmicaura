<h1>class UniversalContainer</h1>
<h2 class="include">#include "ucontainer.h"</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The UniversalContainer class is an attempt to provide a class which
can act in a manner similar to the untyped variables, arrays, and
hash-maps found in popular scripting languages such as perl and PHP.
The result is a class that can hold a wide variety of data and
meta-data in a very flexible structure. UniversalContainers can hold
integers, doubles, booleans, single characters, strings, and wide
character strings. UniversalContainers may also be used as associative
maps between strings and other UniversalContainers, or as arrays of
UniversalContainers.</p>

<p>See an <a href="example.html">example</a>.</p>

<p>To use a UniversalContainer, simply create an instance and assign
any scalar value to the class. Alternatively, you can use the
container as an associative map, using the overloaded brackets
operator to assign a scalar or other UniversalContainer to a string
based key. If you use the brackets operator with a numerical index,
the UniversalContainer will act as an array which expands the first
time you access the first element beyond the end of the list. To
retrieve a value from a UniversalContainer, simply cast the UC back to
the desired type. Illegal casts result in a run time exception, but
every effort is made to make a meaningful cast. For example, you can
always cast an integer to a string containing the decimal
representation, and strings which hold the decimal representation of a
number may be cast to integers; while strings holding other values
will result in a runtime exception.</p>

<p>The <a href="libuc.html">Libuc library</a> also contains a number
of useful routines and classes for working with UniversalContainers.
This includes routines for serialization, database access, CGI
programming, and REST style remote calls.</p>

<h2>Assignment Operators</h2>

<p>The UniversalContainer class overloads the assignment operator for
types long, int, double, bool, char, char*, std::string, std::wstring,
and itself. The first time a value is assigned to a container, the
container will adopt the appropriate type. Future attempts to assign
values of different types to a container will result in an
exception. The exception to this rule is that types int, long, and
double allow for other numeric values to be assigned, and the
container will switch to properly reflect its new contents.</p>

<p>Internally, if a UniversalContainer is holding an string, wstring,
map, or an array, it allocates that appropriate structure on the heap
and stores a pointer to it. The copy constructor for
UniversalContainer copies only the pointer, resulting in a shallow
copy when the UC holds data of these types. This allows for
UniversalContainers to be passed to and returned from functions
without excessive overhead, but it also means that UniversalContainers
holding this type of information are essentially passed by
reference. The number of UniversalContainers referring to a given
collection or string is tracked so that memory is not leaked when
UniversalContainers are copied and destroyed. The clone method can be
used when a deep copy is needed.</p>

<p>The assignment operator also does assignments for arrays and maps
by reference, so that if one container is set equal to another, any
changes to the array or map stored by one are reflected by the
other. In the event that a UniversalContainer holding a string or
wstring is assigned to hold another string, the reference count is
adjusted and the previous string is deleted only if no other
containers are holding the string.</p>

<h2>Casting Operators</h2>

<p>The UniversalContainer class overloads a number of casting
operators, allowing instances holding scalars to be used in place of
scalars of the matching type. Casting an integer or double value to
another value of those types will result in a result similar to a
standard cast of the appropriate type. Bools can be cast to chars,
resulting in either 't' or 'f'. Attempting to cast any scalar to a
string will result in the appropriate conversion, with booleans
returning a value of "true" or "false", and null containers return
"null". Attempting to cast a container to an unsupported type results
in an exception being thrown. Casting a container does not affected
the underlying container.</p>

<p>Attempting to cast an array to a boolean will result in the value
"true" being returned. Attempting to cast a map to a boolean will
result in the value true, unless the map contains the key
"#boolean_value". In this case the container will evaluate to the
value stored in the map with this key. This convention is used by
various routines in the utility library to signal a failure. The
#boolean_value key is set to false, and other fields are set to
describe the failure. This allows the caller of the routine to check
for success or failure by simply testing true/false on the container,
and then extracting appropriate information based on the result.</p>

<h2>The Brackets[] Operator</h2>

<p>The brackets operator on the UniversalContainer class has been
overloaded, allowing the container to act as both an associative map
and a vector, depending on the key. Using a string within the brackets
cause the container to act as a map, mapping between the given string
another UniversalContainer. Numerical indexes cause the container to
act as zero-based vector. Due to limitations of the underlying
std::vector template, a new element is created if an attempt to index
one beyond the current size of the vector is made. Thus, the to create
an array you should first reference the zeroth element, then the
first, and so on. Skipping indexes will result in an exception being
thrown. See the section on <a href="#exceptions">exceptions</a> below
for details.</p>

<p>Maps and Arrays may nest other maps and arrays, accessed by
stacking uses of the brackets operator in the same fashion as
accessing a multidimensional array. Alternatively, a dot notation may
be used to access nested maps and arrays. For instance, if a container
<tt>uc</tt> maps the string "foo" to another map, which in term
contains an element mapped to bar, you can access that element as
either <tt>uc["foo.bar"]</tt> or <tt>uc[foo][bar]</tt>. Array elements
may be referenced by numerical index in a similar fashion. For
instance, if the second element of a vector contains a map with key
"beta", you could access the value associated with beta with
<tt>my_uc_array["1.beta"]</tt>.</p>


<h2>Constructors</h2>
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(void)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(int)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(long)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(double)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(bool)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(char)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(const std::string)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(const std::string)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(char*)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer(const UniversalContainer&)</h3>

<p>A newly constructed UniversalContainer usually has a null type,
waiting for a particular value to be assigned to it. Alternatively, it
may be constructed holding a particular scalar value.</p>

<p>The copy constructor for the UniversalContainer does a shallow
copy. Strings, maps, and vectors held by the container are held be
reference, and a copy will point to the same underlying data. This
increases efficiency when using UniversalContainers in a function call
or returning then as results. When a deep copy of a UniversalContainer
is required, use the <tt>clone</tt> method. UniversalContainers
maintain a shared count of the data objects they point to, and the
last copy to be destroyed will cleanup the memory used.</p> </div>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<div class="method_div">
  <h3 class="method">void init_map(void)</h3>
  <h3 class="method">void init_array(void)</h3>
  
  <p>These methods set a null UniversalContainer to be an empty array
  and an empty map respectively. They are intended to only be called
  on freshly created containers, to force them to be taken on an
  identity as arrays or maps respectively; without having to assign a
  value to them using the [] operator. Useful when you want to return
  something that is an empty array or empty map.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
  <h3 class="method">void string_interpret(const std::string s)</h3>
  
  <p>This method is a pseudo-constructor, intended to be invoked on
  newly created, null valued, UniversalContainers in order to
  initialize them according to the data type represented by the
  contents of a string. First, the method attempts to convert the
  input to a long. If the input can not be converted to a long, it
  then attempts to convert it to a double. If this also fails, it
  checks the length of the input. If length is one it stores the
  single character. If there is more than one character, a case
  insensitive comparison is then made to the strings "true", "false",
  and "null". A match results in the appropriate value being
  set. Otherwise, the input is stored as a string. Attempts to invoke
  this method on a non-null container will result in an exception of
  uce_TypeMismatch_Write.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
  <h3 class="method">UniversalContainer& added_element(void)</h3>
  <p>If the container is a vector, appends an element to the end of the
  vector and returns a reference to it. If the container is not a
  vector, throws an exception with type uce_Non_Array_as_Array.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
    <h3 class="method">UniversalContainer clone(void)</h3>

    <p>Returns a deep copy of the object. By default, the copy constructor
  for Universal Container returns a shallow copy. See the notes under
  the copy constructor for details on why this may be important.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="method_div">
    <h3 class="method">void clear(void)</h3>
    
    <p>Clears the current container. The containers type is reset to null,
    allowing it to once again contain any type of data assigned to it. If
    the container previously contained a string, map, or vector the data
    object will be deleted if and only if it is no longer referenced by
    another UniversalContainer.</p> </div>
    
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool exists(const std::string key)</h3>
<p>Return true if the given key exists in the map, return false
otherwise. If used on a container which is not a map it will return
false.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainerType get_type(void)</h3>
<p>Returns the type associated with this particular instance.
UniversalContainerType is an enumeration, it may take any of the
following values. <tt>uc_Integer, uc_Boolean, uc_Character, uc_String,
uc_Real, uc_Null, uc_Array, uc_Map</tt></p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; keys_for_map(void)</h3>

  <p>Returns a vector of strings, giving the keys for the map.
  Otherwise, throws uce_Non_Map_as_Map.</p>

</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool remove(const std::string key)</h3>

  <p>Removes the given key from a map, or throws a uce_Non_Map_as_Map
exception if used on a container which is not a map.</p> </div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">size_t size(void)</h3>
<h3 class="method">size_t length(void)</h3>
  
  <p>Return the number of keys in the map, or the number of elements
in the vector, or zero for containers holding atomic types.</p> </div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">const char* c_str(void) const</h3>

  <p>If the UniversalContainer is holding a string, this returns the
  pointer to the underlying characters just like calling
  string::c_str. Otherwise, it throws uce_TypeMismatch_Read.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">UniversalMap::iterator map_begin(void)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalMap::iterator map_end(void)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalArray::iterator vector_begin(void)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalArray::iterator vector_end(void)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalMap& get_map(void)</h3>
<h3 class="method">UniversalArray& get_vector(void)</h3>

  <p>When used to store maps and arrays, UniversalContainers do so by
pointing to UniversalMap and UniversalArray objects, as appropriate.
These are typedefed as std::map&lt;std::string,UniversalContainer&gt;
and std::vector&lt;UniversalContainer&gt; respectively. These methods
return the corresponding iterators, or the underlying object as
appropriate. These may be useful for using UniversalContainer with
algorithms from the C++ STL, or otherwise manipulating the structure
of the map or vector. If used on a container with the inappropriate
type they will throw an exception.</p> </div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool is_dirty(void)</h3>
<h3 class="method">void clean(void)</h3>

  <p>Each UniversalContainer contains a dirty flag, which indicates if
  its contents have changed. This flag is set to true when the UC is first
  constructed, and set reset to true whenever the container takes on a
  new atomic value. Array type containers have this flag set whenever
  an element is added. This flag is only cleared when the
  <tt>clean</tt> method is called.</p>
  
  <p>For UCs containing atomic types, <tt>is_dirty</tt> returns true when
  the flag is set. For arrays and maps, this method returns true when
  the flag is set or whenever the is_dirty method of one of their
  component elements returns true.</p>

</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="macro">ucexception(int code)</h3>
<p>This macro takes one of the codes from the table below, and
  constructs a UniversalContainer representing an exception. The
  intended use is as part of a throw statement such as : <tt>throw
  ucexception(uce_Unknown);</tt>. If debugging information is
  available this UC will contain information about the function, file,
  and line where it was invoked.</p>
</div>
  

<a name="exceptions"/>
<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>Many of the methods and overloaded operators defined by the
UniversalContainer class can result in an exception being
thrown. The thrown exceptions are themselves UniversalContainers,
containing a map with a variety of information. Although these are
runtime errors, most of the exceptions represent programming
errors. In most cases, a top level try/catch block which prints the
exception for debugging purposes is sufficient.</p>

<p>Many of the functions which work with UniversalContainers, such as
the database routines and the various serialization and
deserialization routines also throw UniversalContainers as
exceptions.</p>
