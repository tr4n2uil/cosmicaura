<h1>struct Buffer</h1>
<h2 class="include">#include "buffer.h"</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Buffer class provides a simple, file like mechanism that
operates in memory. It is intended to provide a bridge between the
wide variety of file and file like mechanisms commonly found in C and
C++ libraries. The class itself provides an in memory buffer for read
and write operations, and tracks the read and write position
separately. A write past of the end of currently allocated memory
results in the available buffer size being doubled. A selection of
utility functions allows for reading and writing of buffers to sources
such as system sockets, C files, C++ streams, and CURL handles. In
most instances, client code will interact with buffers through the
utility routines, rather than through member functions.</p>

<p>If the member variable own_data is set to false, then the
buffer can not be grown, and the underlying storage space will
not be cleaned up when the Buffer is deleted. This allows Buffer
to be used to wrap storage space that is managed elsewhere, or that
comes from other similar classes in other libraries. It is also useful
when Buffer is wrapped around a static string.</p>

<h2>Member Variables</h2>
<table class="dictionary">
<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td>char* data</td><td>Data held in the buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>size_t size</td><td>Allocated size of data member</td></tr>
<tr><td>size_t rpos</td><td>Position of the read head</td></tr>
<tr><td>size_t wpos</td><td>Position of the write head</td></tr>
<tr><td>size_t length</td><td>Number of bytes the buffer contains</td></tr>
<tr><td>bool own_data</td><td>Whether or not this buffer objects owns
  the underlying data.</td></tr>
  </table>
  
<h2>Constructor</h2>
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">Buffer(int sz = 4k)</h3>
  <p>Creates a new, empty, Buffer class, with an initial internal buffer size of
  4k.</p>
  </div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">Buffer(char* str)</h3>
  <p>Creates a buffer, using the given string as the storage
  space. The write position is set to the end of the string, and the
  length is set to strlen(str). The resulting buffer can not be grown,
  and when it is deleted the string remains.</p>
  </div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">Buffer(void* d, size_t len)</h3>
  <p>Creates a buffer, using the given array of bytes as the storage
  space. The write position is set to len, as is the length of the
  buffer. The resulting buffer can not be grown,
  and when it is deleted the string remains.</p>
  </div>
  
<h2>Methods</h2>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool put_data(const char* data, int length)</h3>
<p>Copy length bytes from data into the buffer. Updates the read
  position accordingly, and expands the internal memory buffer as
  required. Returns true on success and false on failure.</p>
</div>
  
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">char* fetch_data(size_t len)</h3>
<p>If there are not at least len bytes from the current read position to the
  end of buffer this method returns NULL. Otherwise, the read pointer
  is advanced by len bytes and a pointer to the previous read position
  is returned. Note that the pointer returned by this routine is the
  same block the object instance uses to store data, and it is owned
  by the Buffer instance.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool ensure_space(size_t len)</h3>
<p>Ensures that the underlying internal buffer has at least len
  unused bytes. If len bytes are already available, nothing more is
  done. If len is not available, the buffer is doubled until len bytes
  are available. Mostly used by the provide write methods, client code
  will rarely need this method. Returns true on success and false on
  failure.</p>
</div>
  
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">size_t copy_out(char* dest, size_t len)</h3>
<p>This method copies up to len bytes from the current read position
  to dest. A null-terminator is not written. The number of bytes
  actually copied is returned.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">char* get_line(void)</h3>
<p>Reads from the buffer until the end of the buffer or a newline
  character is found. A null-terminated string is returned. Unlike
  fetch_data, this returned string is owned by the client and should
  be deleted (not freed) when the client is finished with it.</p>
</div>
  
  <div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool end(void) const</h3>
<p>Returns true is the read pointer has reached the end of the buffer,
    false otherwise.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">void rewind(void)</h3>
<p>Rewinds both the read and write positions to the beginning of the
  buffer. The buffer contents are not affected.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">void clear(void)</h3>
<p>Clears the buffer, reseting read and write positions, and buffer contents.</p>
</div>
	
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool seek(size_t pos)</h3>
  <p>Sets both the read and write position to pos.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool put(char datum)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool put(unsigned char datum)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool put(int datum)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool put(long datum)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool put(bool datum)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool put(double datum)</h3>

  <p>This group of methods writes the given value to the buffer. If
  necessary the internal buffer is expanded. Returns true on success
  and false on failure.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool fetch(char& retval)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool fetch(unsigned char& retval)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool fetch(int& retval)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool fetch(long& retval)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool fetch(bool& retval)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool fetch(double& retval)</h3>
<p>This group of methods reads a value out of the buffer and into the
  provided variable. Returns true on success and false on failure.</p>
</div>

<h2>Non-member Utility Functions</h2>
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">bool write_from_buffer(Buffer*, ostream& stream)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool write_from_buffer(Buffer*, FILE* file)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool write_from_buffer(Buffer*, int socket)</h3>
<h3 class="method">bool write_from_buffer(Buffer*, const char* filename)</h3>
  <p>These routines send the entire contents of the buffer to the
  given destination. Note that the version that takes an int works on
  any file descriptor, not just sockets.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method"> Buffer* read_to_buffer(istream& stream)</h3>
<h3 class="method"> Buffer* read_to_buffer(FILE* file)</h3>
<h3 class="method"> Buffer* read_to_buffer(int socket)</h3>
<h3 class="method"> Buffer* read_to_buffer(const char* filename)</h3>
<p>These routines read from the given source and place the entire
  contents, up till end of file, in the buffer. Note that the version
  that takes an int works on any file descriptor, not just
  sockets.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div"> 
<h3 class="method"> Buffer* base64_encode(Buffer*)</h3>
<p>Encode the given buffer into base64 format, and return the
result. Returns NULL on failure.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method"> Buffer* base64_decode(Buffer*)</h3> 
<p>Given a buffer containing data encoded in base64 format, this
routine returns a decoded version of that data. Returns NULL on
failure.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
   <p><em class="warning">This method requires that LibUC be built with
  libcurl support.</em></p>
 
 <h3 class="method"> Buffer* http_post_buffer(const char* url, Buffer*
 send, string& mime_type_returned, const char* mime_type_sent = NULL,
 const int timeout = -1)</h3>
<p>This function does an HTTP POST request of the buffer send to given
 url. The mime_type of the resulting response is stored in
 mime_type_returned. If mime_type_sent is not provided, or is NULL,
 the HTTP POST request will be made with mime type
 "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", which is the type used when
 sending forms from a browser to a web server. Otherwise, the post
 request will be made using the given mime type. This can be useful
 when working with RESTful services. The buffer containing the servers
 response is returned. If timeout is allowed to default, the default
 timeout provided by the underlying CURL library will be
 used. Otherwise, timeout provides the timeout for the operation in seconds.</p>
  </div>
  
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method"> Buffer* http_get_buffer(const char* url, string&
  mime_type, const int timeout = -1)</h3>

  <p><em class="warning">This method requires that LibUC be built with
  libcurl support.</em></p>
 
  <p>This function sends an HTTP GET to the specified URL, and returns the
  results in a buffer. The string mime_type is set to the mime_type of
  the data retrieved. If timeout is allowed to default, the default
 timeout provided by the underlying CURL library will be
 used. Otherwise, timeout provides the timeout for the operation in seconds.</p>
