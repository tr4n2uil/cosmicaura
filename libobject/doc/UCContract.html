<h1>class UCContract</h1>
<h2 class="include">#include "uccontract.h"</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>UCContract provides a means to evaluate a given UniversalContainer object
against an arbitrary contract, and determining if it matches that contract. The
primary intent is to provide an easy means of checking incoming JSON objects
to ensure they are formatted as expected, but it can also be used to verify
objects on deserialization, post requests, or as a means of checking other input.</p>

<h2>Describing a Contract</h2>
<p>Instances of UCContract are created from UniversalContainers
describing the contract. Contract descriptors are maps which contain
the key "type". This key must map to a string designating the type of
UniversalContainer the contract describes. Other members of the contract description
are optional, and dependent on the type. If present, these members
restrict the range of possible values that the given element may take on.</p>

<p><table class="dictionary">
  <tr>
    <th>Type / <br/> Constraint</th>
    <th>Value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>Contract matches a UC holding a boolean value.<td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>character</td>
    <td>Contract matches a UC holding a character.<td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Contract matches a UC holding a string.<td>
  </tr>

    <td>A regular expression the string must match. Uses regexec from
  the standard C library.<td>

    <td>Contract matches a UC holding a character.<td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>

    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;required_members</td>
    <td>Must map to another map. Each member of this map is a map
  between a string and another map specifying a contact. The map being

  conform to the contract given for that key.<td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;optional_members</td>
    <td>Must map to another map. Each member of this map is a map
  between a string and another map specifying a contact. The map being
  checked must may contain of the specified keys, and each key must
  conform to the contract given for that key if it appears. It is not
  a violation of the contract if some optional member does not appear.<td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>array</td>
    <td>Contract matches a UC holding an array.<td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;size</td>
    <td>Specifies a contract of type integer. The size of the array
  must match the bounds given in the contract.<td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;forall</td>
    <td>Specifies a contract which every member of the array must satisfy.<td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;exists</td>
    <td>Specifies an array of contracts. For each element of this
  array, the matched container must contain an element matching the
  given contract. Note that an element may match multiple entries in
  the exists array.<td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>When a contract is created any required regex is compiled and saved
for later use. Otherwise, creating a new instance of UCContract is not
terribly expensive. However, in most cases it will involved
deserializing the UniversalContainer describing the contract; most
likely from some JSON source. This can be expensive, especially if it
involves an I/O operation. Therefore, it is recommend that instance
of UCContract we initialized once and then retained in some globally
accessible store for later comparisons.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Below is an example of a contract description in JSON, showing how
to use the various elements. To use a contract like this, you would
first deserialize the JSON to a UniversalContainer using
uc_decode_json, and then pass the resulting UC to the constructor for
a UCContract object.</p>

    "type" : "map",
    "required_members" : {
	"name" : {
	    "type" : "string",
	    "regex" : "[A-Z][a-z]*\\ [A-Z][a-z]"

<h2>Constructor</h2>
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">UCContract(UniversalContainer& uc)</h3>
<p>Creates a new UCContract object from the description provided by
  the UniversalContainer uc. See explanation above.</p>
</div>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method"> unsigned compare(const UniversalContainer& uc)
  const</h3>
  <p>Compares the container uc against the contract, and returns 0 if
  uc matches the contract. A non-zero return value indicates one or
  more violations of the contract; depending on which bits of the
  return code are set. Note that in the case of arrays and maps, there
  is no indication of which element caused a particular flag to be
  set, and there may be multiple violations of the same type.</p>

  <table class="dictionary">
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_IMPROPER_TYPE</td>
      <td>The container or one or more of its elements has the wrong data type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION</td>
      <td>The value of the container violates the constraints
	specified in the contract. This is also the flag that signals
    an array that has violated its size constraints, or for which some
    element has violated that forall constraint.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_EXTRA_MAP_ELEMENT</td>
      <td>A map contains one or more elements that are not specified in as required or optional.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_MISSING_REQUIRED_MAP_ELEMENT</td>
      <td>A map is missing an element that is marked as required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_MISSING_REQUIRED_ARRAY_ELEMENT</td>
      <td>An array does not contain an element that is specified in
    the exists constraint.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ucc_STRING_DOES_NOT_MATCH</td>
      <td>Some string does not match the given regex expression.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">void compare_and_throw(UniversalContainer&, unsigned = 0XFFFFFFFF) const</h3>
  <p>This method calls compare on the given container, and performs an
  or operation between the mask and the result of the compare
  operation. If the final result is non-zero then a UniversalContainer
  is thrown as an <a
  href="UniversalContainer.html#exceptions">exception</a>. The
  resulting exception has the code key set to
  uce_ContractViolation, and the key compare_result set to the value
  of the compare operation ored with the mask. The key violations
  maps to an array of strings containing the same messages produced by
  the error_messages method.</p>
  </div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">static std::vector<const char*> error_messages(unsigned result)</h3>
  <p>When passed a result code, this method will return a vector of
  error messages in English matching the flags sets in the
  result. This is a utility method to make debugging easier.</p>
  </div>
