<h1>LibUC</h1>

<h2 class="include">#include "uc_web.h"</h2>

<p>LibUC provides set of routines for web and REST based
programming. These include routines for basic cgi programming and for
posting and retrieving UniversalContainers to and from web
services.</p>

<p>The web_rpc_call and web_rpc_return functions are intended to work
with the init_cgi to provide a complete, easy to use, remote call
mechanism. The intended use pattern begins with the client, which
creates a UniversalContainer containing the variables of the
request. It uses this request object to call web_rpc_call. The server
receives this request by calling init_cgi. The server can then check
the "post" key to retrieve the request object. Once the server has
constructed a response object it uses that object to call
web_rpc_return. The client then receives this response as the return
value of the initial web_rpc_call.</p>

<h2>CGI Functions</h2>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer init_cgi(void)</h3>

  <p><strong>Note: This method must be called before the cgi program
reads any input from stdin.</strong> This function returns a
dictionary describing the input and environment of a cgi program. It
attempts to parse get and post variables into UniversalContainers if
possible. It understands both traditional HTTP form posts, and data
sent in json format. The table below describes the entries in the
dictionary.

  <table class="dictionary">
    <tr><th>Key</th><th>Value</th></tr>
    <tr><td>get</td><td>If get variables where sent to the cgi script,
    this value holds a dictionary of those variables, and will
    evaluate to true in a boolean cast. Otherwise it
    evaluates to false.</td></tr>
    
    <tr><td>post</td><td>If post variables where sent to the cgi script,
    this value holds a dictionary of those variables, and will
    evaluate to true in a boolean cast. Otherwise it
    evaluates to false. init_cgi understands both
    <i>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</i> and <i>application/json</i> formats
    for post data.</td></tr>
  
    <tr><td>cookies</td><td>If cookies where sent to the cgi script,
    this value holds a dictionary of those variables, and will
    evaluate to true in a boolean cast. Otherwise it
    evaluates to false.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>env</td><td>Contains a dictionary of the environmental
      variables passed to the cgi program.</td></tr>
      
      <tr><td>stdin_available</td><td>Boolean that indicates whether or
    not the stdin stream was consumed by init_cgi. Generally, this
    will be false when post data was read, and false when it was not
    available or in a format not understood by init_cgi.</td></tr>
    </table>

<h2>Web RPC Functions</h2>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer web_rpc_call(const char* url, 
				  UniversalContainer& request,
				  const char* mime_type)</h3>

  <p><em class="warning">This method requires that LibUC be built with
  libcurl support.</em></p>
  
  <p>This method formats the provided request object according to the
  provided mime_type, and then does an HTTP post of this formatted
  data to the given url. The response from the server is interpreted
  based on the returning mime type, and parsed to produce the
  UniversalContainer which is returned. The understood types are
  <i>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</i> and <i>application/json</i>, and if
  mime_type is NULL, mime_type will default to
  <i>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</i>.</p>
</div>

<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">void web_rpc_return(UniversalContainer& uc, const
  char* mime_type)</h3>

  <p>This method formats the passed UniversalContainer according to the
  provided mime_type, then prints the mime-type and container to
  stdout. It provides an easy way for servers to respond to clients
  that use web_rpc_call. Understood types are
  <i>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</i> and <i>application/json</i>, and if
  mime_type is NULL, mime_type will default to
  <i>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</i>.</p>

</div>
  
<div class="method_div">
<h3 class="method">UniversalContainer web_fetch(const char* url)</h3>

  <p><em class="warning">This method requires that LibUC be built with
  libcurl support.</em></p>
  
  <p>Retrieves a set of name/value pairs from a given url, using HTTP
  get. This method checks the mime-type and uses that to determine how
  to parse the data. Understood types are
  <i>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</i> and <i>application/json</i>. Most web
  documents are not formatted in this fashion, but some software such
  as couchDB provides data in this fashion.</p>
